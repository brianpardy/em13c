Welcome to ./create_user_for_checksec13R2.sh, version 1.0, released 20170314.

Download the latest release of this script at any time from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianpardy/em13c/master/create_user_for_checksec13R2.sh

This script exists to supplement checksec13R2.sh and enable additional checks. When run, this
script will create a user named CHECKSEC in your EM13cR2 environment and give that user a 
random password, which gets printed to the screen at the end of the script. The script then
grants CHECKSEC VIEW_ANY_TARGET and EM_ALL_OPERATOR privilege, and then prompts you to supply 
the names of credentials existing in your EM13cR2 environment. The script validates the names of 
credentials supplied, grants VIEW access to CHECKSEC for each credential, and assigns those 
credentials as preferred credentials for CHECKSEC for each relevant target.

Providing credentials for the repository database enables the following additional checks in 
checksec13R2.sh:
	* Check for presence/absence of plugin bundle patches on all agents

Providing host credentials for every monitored host running an agent enables the following
additional checks in checksec13R2.sh:
	* Check for presence/absence of the latest Java version on all agents

Login to EMCLI as SYSMAN before running this script. If you already have an CHECKSEC account,
running this script will delete and recreate it with a new password.
